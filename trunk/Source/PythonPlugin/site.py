****************************************************************
* This module is automatically imported during initialization. *
****************************************************************

In earlier versions of Python (up to 1.5a3), scripts or modules that
needed to use site-specific modules would place ``import site''
somewhere near the top of their code.  Because of the automatic
import, this is no longer necessary (but code that does it still
works).
